<h3>The early days</h3>

<p>
  I'm a Seattle local, born and raised in Ballard. I was raised by two loving parents, my brother and of course the Simpsons. My brother has been a large influence on my life, one of my earliest memories is playing Mario on the NES with my him. My family also included many animals; dogs, cats, gerbils, rats, and fish. My parents still live in my childhood home. Growing up, my parents always wanted me to be active. I couldn't tell you all the things they had me do, but a few things stuck with me. I was thrown into a pool to learn to swim around the same time I learned to walk. Acting camps right around the time I could speak. When swimming got old, I was thrown into soccer. When soccer got old, I jumped back into the pool. School was always a mixed bag of way too hard and way too easy. I struggled with writing, but excelled in reading. I learned in middle school I was diagnosed with a form of dyslexia. High school was sorta a blur, I wasn't the best student ever but, managed to squeak by and graduate.

<h3>The now</h3>

<p>
  I've been working at pacific science center for just over 9 years. I love my job, but the pay is rough. My job is to get on stage, or in the planetarium and performan for an audience. I also work on the exhibit floor and teach our guests about the exhibits. Finaly my job does involve teaching fellow staff how to do the things I do.
</p>

<h3>The future</h3>

<p>
  I'm a programer! I look forward to getting a job in the CS feild. I've always wanted to learn more about computers.

<!--  Goals Lab 2
  1. Add Question 5
    *One of these questions should include the use of logical operators (refer to page ~157 of the JS text book for example usage). As a secondary example, one of your questions can validate use input in the form of 'Yes' and 'Y', or 'No' and 'N'.

  2. Add Question 6
    *One of the questions should include multiple answers (more than two). These answers can be stored in an array, and you will want to use the array method indexOf() to find out whether the user's guess exists in the array or not. If it does, use the index returned to you to select that value and tell the user that they guessed the answer correct.

  3.Use CSS to style your page as you see fit, to the level of abilities in CSS that you currently have.

  4.Add, Commit, Push process is being followed; evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages.
