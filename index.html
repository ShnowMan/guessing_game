<h3>The early days</h3>

<p>
  I'm a seattle local, born and rasied in Ballard. I was rasied by two loving parents, my brother and of course the simpsons. My brother has been a large influence on my life, one of my earliest memories is playing mario on the NES with my him. My family also included many animals; dogs, cats, gerbals, rats, and fish. My parents still live in my childhood home. Growing up, my parents always wanted me to be active. I couldn't tell you all the things they had me do, but a few things stuck with me. I was thrown into a pool to learn to swim around the same time I leanred to walk. Acting camps right around the time I could speak. When swimming got old, I was thrown into soccor. When soccor got old, I jumped back into the pool. School was always a mixed bag of way too hard and way too easy. I struggled with writting, but excelled in reading. I learned in middle school I was diginosed with a form of dyslexia. High school was sorta a blur, I wasn't the best student ever but, manged to squeak by and graduate.
</p>

<h3>The now</h3>

<p>
  I've been working at pacific science center for just over 9 years. I love my job, but the pay is rough. My job is to get on stage, or in the planetarium and performan for an audience. I also work on the exhibit floor and teach our guests about the exhibits. Finaly my job does involve teaching fellow staff how to do the things I do.
</p>

<h3>The future</h3>

<p>
  I'm a programer! I look forward to getting a job in the CS feild. I've always wanted to learn more about computers.
