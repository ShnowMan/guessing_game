<h3>The early days</h3>
<!-- note to self, fix all spelling errors! -->
<section>


<p>
  I'm a Seattle local, born and raised in Ballard. I was raised by two loving parents, my brother and of course the Simpsons. My brother has been a large influence on my life, one of my earliest memories is playing Mario on the NES with my him. My family also included many animals; dogs, cats, gerbils, rats, and fish. My parents still live in my childhood home. Growing up, my parents always wanted me to be active. I couldn't tell you all the things they had me do, but a few things stuck with me. I was thrown into a pool to learn to swim around the same time I learned to walk. Acting camps right around the time I could speak. When swimming got old, I was thrown into soccer. When soccer got old, I jumped back into the pool. School was always a mixed bag of way too hard and way too easy. I struggled with writing, but excelled in reading. I learned in middle school I was diagnosed with a form of dyslexia. High school was sorta a blur, I wasn't the best student ever but, managed to squeak by and graduate.
</p>


<h3>The now</h3>

<p>
  I've been working at pacific science center for just over 9 years. I love my job, but the pay is rough. My job is to get on stage, or in the planetarium and performan for an audience. I also work on the exhibit floor and teach our guests about the exhibits. Finaly my job does involve teaching fellow staff how to do the things I do.
</p>

<h3>The future</h3>

<p>
  I'm a programer! I look forward to getting a job in the CS feild. I've always wanted to learn more about computers.

<!--
      Goals Lab 1
  1. Create personal guessing game. 4 Y/N questions.
      a. Animals
      b. Fear
      c. Zelda
      d. Pie
  2. Create Bio/resume.
      bio facts
        a. Hobbies?
        b. Family?
        c. Other intreastes?
      resume
        volunteer service
        job experience
        education

        Goals Lab 2
  1. Add Question 5
    *One of these questions should include the use of logical operators (refer to page ~157 of the JS text book for example usage). As a secondary example, one of your questions can validate use input in the form of 'Yes' and 'Y', or 'No' and 'N'.
    * var questionFive = prompt ('Do you think I'm afraid of sharks?').toUpperCase();
      console.log('questionFive = ' + questionFive)
      if(questionFive === 'N' || questionFive === 'NO'){
      alert('You\'re right. Sharks are actually very misunderstood creatures. Most shark "Attacks" are a case of mistaken identity.);
    } else{
    alert(Belive it or not, I have no fear of sharks. I've dove with them several time. I\'m actually way more afraid of porpoises.)
  }
  2. Add Question 6
    *One of the questions should include multiple answers (more than two). These answers can be stored in an array, and you will want to use the array method indexOf() to find out whether the user's guess exists in the array or not. If it does, use the index returned to you to select that value and tell the user that they guessed the answer correct.
*
  3.Use CSS to style your page as you see fit, to the level of abilities in CSS that you currently have.

  4.Add, Commit, Push process is being followed; evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages.



Lab 3
Goals Lab 3:
  1.biographical elements into unordered lists, such as my education summary and/or my work experience.
    *Security Press
      V- Food Bank
      V- Leif Erikson Lodge
    *Pacific Science Center
    *Motion Simulator
    *Pita Express

  2.Top Ten list to the bottom of my About Me page with an ordered list in HTML, for instance, my Top Ten Favorite Movies or my Top Ten Places I Want to Visit, or something along those lines.

  <h3>Jeff King's Top Ten Animes!</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Avatar: The last air bender</li>
      <li>Dragon Ball Z</li>
      <li>Wing Gundam</li>
      <li>One Piece</li>
      <li>Trigun</li>
      <li>Cowboy Bebop</li>
      <li>Death Note</li>
      <li>One Punch Man</li>
      <li>s-CRY-ed</li>
      <li>Naruto</li>
  </ol>

  3.As a prospective job seeker, I was to use CSS to creatively and tastefully style my page.

    Boxes, Fonts, Colors, Sizes, Alignment

  4.I want to add a sixth question to my guessing game that takes numeric input, and indicates to the user whether the guess is 'too high' or 'too low', and gives the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer

    My dog\(cocker spaniel\) at home is getting pretty old, How old would you guess she is?
    A: 17 (Pretty old for a puppy don't you think?)
    A: <17 (Older than that, she's older than most highschoolers!)
    A: >17 (I really hope she lives that long, but she isn\'t there yet.)

  5. I want to add a seventh question to my guessing game that accepts multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array, for instance, "Can you guess a state that I have lived in besides Washington?", so that even more of my programming skills are showcased. For now, I will structure this question so that the user has six tries to get a single correct answer, and upon exhausting those tries OR getting a correct answer, displays a message to the user indicating all of the possible correct answers.

  Since I\'m making you guess things, what\'s one of my top three favorite (summer)olympic sports?

    A = [swimming, table tennis, bicycling] (Great Job! swimming table tennis and bicycling are the only sports I bother to watch in the summer olympics.)

  6.As a developer, I want to keep a tally of the total number of correct answers given by the user, and at the end of the game, tell the user how well they did with a personalized custom message that includes the number of correct answers and also addresses the user by name, e.g. "You got 4 out of 7 questions correct, Bobbi! Better luck next time."
