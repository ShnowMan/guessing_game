<h3>The early days</h3>
<p>
  I'm a seattle local, born and rasied in Ballard. I was rasied by two loving parents, my brother and of course the simpsons. My brother has been a large influence on my life. One of my earliest memories is playing mario on the NES with my him. My family also included many animals; dogs, cats, gerbals, rats, and fish.

  <li>Do you think I love animals?</li>
  <li>Do you think I like bungie jumping?</li>
  <li>Is there a better video game than "Zelda: Ocarina of Time?"</li>
  <li>Is pie better than cake?</li>
</ol>
